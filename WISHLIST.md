# What about it?

I would love to do following things:

- Will focus on layout because right now it's not soo friendly.
- Right now I am serving file from reactJS application by placing file in the public folder but I want to make a small server in order to serve file.
- I am using context for only one thing but I want to use it for everything.
- Will write some test cases like unit +  end-to-end tests so that I make sure that my functionality is working fine. But i want to use cypress instead of jest for unit tests.
- Want to use redux for the data passing.
- Right now I tried to make it dynamic so that any user can upload it's own csv file and this table should be capable enough to show that data including columns.
- Need to focus on total sum section table is dynamic so I am good with that but total sum section is not dynamic because we are displaying limited fields data in it so define rules to show columns data in it.
